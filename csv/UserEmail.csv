Hi Sam,
Just double-checking - are we still on for the 10 AM meeting tomorrow in Room 204? I wanted to make sure I have the latest agenda. Let me know if anything's changed.
Thanks!

Hey Jack!
I'm putting together something small for my birthday this Saturday - just a few friends, snacks, maybe some board games. Would love for you to come by if you're free. Let me know and I'll send you the details!
Talk soon,
Eddie

Hi Professor Cui,
I've attached the final version of my project, along with the documentation and dataset. Please let me know if you need anything else from me or if there are any issues opening the files.
Thank you for a great semester!
Best,
Taylor
